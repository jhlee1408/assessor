# QQ-plots of DPIT residuals

Makes a QQ-plot of the DPIT residuals calculated from
[`resid_disc()`](https://jhlee1408.github.io/assessor/reference/resid_disc.md),
[`resid_semiconti()`](https://jhlee1408.github.io/assessor/reference/resid_semiconti.md)
or
[`resid_zeroinfl()`](https://jhlee1408.github.io/assessor/reference/resid_zeroinfl.md).
The plot should be close to the diagonal if the model is correctly
specified. Note that this function does not return residuals. To get
both residuals and QQ-plot, use
[`resid_disc()`](https://jhlee1408.github.io/assessor/reference/resid_disc.md),
[`resid_semiconti()`](https://jhlee1408.github.io/assessor/reference/resid_semiconti.md)
and
[`resid_zeroinfl()`](https://jhlee1408.github.io/assessor/reference/resid_zeroinfl.md).

## Usage

``` r
qqresid(model, scale="normal")
```

## Arguments

- model:

  Fitted model object (e.g.,
  [`glm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/glm.html),
  [`glm.nb()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/MASS/man/glm.nb.html),
  [`zeroinfl()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/pscl/man/zeroinfl.html), and
  [`polr()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/MASS/man/polr.html))

- scale:

  You can choose the scale of the residuals between `normal` and
  `uniform` scales. The sample quantiles of the residuals are plotted
  against the theoretical quantiles of a standard normal distribution
  under the normal scale, and against the theoretical quantiles of a
  uniform (0,1) distribution under the uniform scale. The defalut scale
  is `normal`.

## Value

A QQ plot.

- x-axis: Theoretical quantiles

- y-axis: Sample quantiles generated by DPIT residuals

## Examples

``` r
n <- 100
b <- c(2, 1, -2)
x1 <- rnorm(n)
x2 <- rbinom(n, 1, 0.7)
y <- rpois(n, exp(b[1] + b[2] * x1 + b[3] * x2))

m1 <- glm(y ~ x1 + x2, family = poisson)
qqresid(m1, scale = "normal")

qqresid(m1, scale = "uniform")
```
