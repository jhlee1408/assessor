## Overview
The goal of assessor is to provide assessment tools for regression models with discrete and semicontinuous outcomes proposed in [Yang (2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15596.pdf). It calculates the double probability integral transorm (DPIT) residuals, constructs QQ plots of residuals and the ordered curve for assessing mean structures.
