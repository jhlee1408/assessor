# assessor


## Overview
The goal of assessor is to provide assessment tools for regression models with discrete and semicontinuous outcomes proposed in [Yang (2024)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15596.pdf) and [Yang(2024)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06347.pdf). It calculates the double probability integral transform (DPIT) residuals, constructs QQ plots of residuals for model diagnostics, and constructs the ordered curve for assessing mean structures.
