\description{
This dataset provides annual statistics for Major League Baseball (MLB) players, including home run counts, at-bats, mean exit velocities, launch angles, quantile statistics of exit velocities and launch angles, and red zone metrics. It is intended for analyzing batted ball performance, with additional variables on the red zone, which is defined as balls in play with a launch angle between 20 and 35 degrees and an exit velocity of at least 95 mph.

\details{
\describe{
\item{Mean Metrics}{\code{mean_exit_velo} and \code{mean_launch_angle} represent the player's average exit velocities and launch angles, respectively, over the course of a season.}
\item{Quantile Metrics}{The \code{launch_angle_xx} and \code{exit_velo_xx} columns denote the upper \eqn{x}-percentiles (e.g., 75th percentile) of the player's launch angle and exit velocity distributions for that year.}
\item{Red Zone Metrics}{\code{count_red_zone} gives the number of balls in play that fall into the red zone, while \code{prop_red_zone} represents the proportion of balls in play in this category.}
\item{BPF}{The Ballpark Factor (BPF) quantifies the influence of the player's home ballpark on offensive performance, with values above 100 indicating a hitter-friendly environment.}
