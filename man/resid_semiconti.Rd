\title{Residuals for semicontinuous outcome regression}
\usage{
resid_semiconti(model, plot=TRUE, scale = "normal")
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{model object(using tweedie family)}

\item{plot}{A logical value indicating whether or not to return QQ-plot}

\item{scale}{You can choose the scale of residuals among \code{normal} and \code{uniform} scales. The defalut scale is \code{normal}.}
}
\value{
The double probability integral transform residuals(DPIT residuals).
}
\description{
\code{resid.semiconti} is used to calculate newly proposed residuals for semi-continuous outcomes regression such as tweedie model.
A model object of semicontinuous regression from \code{tweedie} package is recommended.
}
\details{
The proposed residuals are defined as
\deqn{\hat{r}_i = \frac{\hat{F}(Y_i|X_i)}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}I\bigg(\hat{p}_0(X_j) \leq \hat{F}(Y_i|X_i)\bigg)}
, which has a null distribution of uniformity.
