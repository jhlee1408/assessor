# assessor

## Overview

The goal of assessor is to provide assessment tools for regression
models with discrete and semicontinuous outcomes proposed in [Yang
(2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15596.pdf). It calculates the double
probability integral transform (DPIT) residuals, constructs QQ plots of
residuals and the ordered curve for assessing mean structures.
