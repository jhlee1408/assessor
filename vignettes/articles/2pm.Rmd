### Two part models {.tabset .tabset-pills}
The input arguments for the `resid_2pm()` function differ from those of other functions in `assessor` package. Specifically, users can utilize this function with either models or Probability Integral Transform (PIT) as input.

For instance, in evaluating the distribution assumptions of a two-part model that combines a logistic and a gamma regression, you should provide the logistic regression model object as the argument for `model0` and the gamma regression model object for `model1`. We recommend utilizing the model input when assessing a gamma + logistic two-part model. Alternatively, users can directly use the PIT as input if their two-part model is not a gamma+logistic combination. In such cases, users should first calculate the PIT and then input into `part0` and `part1`, respectively.

This function accommodates two combinations: either `model0` in conjunction with `model1` or `part0` in conjunction with `part1`. Note that it is essential to specify the `y` (outcome) values in the function arguments.


The underlying model  is a two-part model. The probability of zero is  $$p_0(\mathbf{X})=\text{logit}^{-1}\left(\beta_0+X_{1}\beta_{1}+X_{2}\beta_{2} \right),$$
where $X_1$ is a standard normal variable,  $X_2$ is binary with probability of one as 0.4, and $(\beta_0,\beta_{1},\beta_{2})=(1,-2,-1)$.  
A gamma distribution is employed to generate positive data. The mean function of the positive part is described as $$\lambda_S=\exp\left(\beta_{0S}+\beta_{1S}X_1+\beta_{2S}X_2\right).$$ 
We let  $(\beta_{0S},\beta_{1S},\beta_{2S})=(-1,-1,-2)$. The dispersion parameter is set to be 0.5.
